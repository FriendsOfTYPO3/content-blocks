YAML reference
==============

The heart of a Content Block is the `config.yaml` file. Here you can
find all possible configuration options. There are slight differences, whether
you are dealing with :ref:`Content Elements <yaml_reference_content_element>`,
:ref:`Page Types <yaml_reference_page_types>` or
:ref:`Record Types <yaml_reference_record_type>`. In general Content Elements
and Page Types are a special concept in TYPO3. The Core already defines the
table names, the type field, etc. You just have to define a new type. This is
done by providing the :yaml:`name` attribute, which will be converted to the
type name. Page Types require an integer value for the type. Therefore you need
to set it additionally with :yaml:`typeName`.

With TYPO3 you can also create custom Record Types. They require you to define
a custom :yaml:`table` and a :yaml:`labelField` field. Per default all extra
features like workspaces, language support, frontend restrictions, etc. are
enabled. You can selectively disable each one of them, if you don't use them.
