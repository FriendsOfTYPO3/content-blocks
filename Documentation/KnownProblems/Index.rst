On save error: Row size too large (MariaDB)
===========================================

Explanation
-----------

There is a limit on how much can fit into a single InnoDB database row. Read `here <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/innodb-row-formats-overview/#maximum-row-size>`__ for more technical insight.
As Content Blocks uses the table :sql:`tt_content`, it must be ensured, that the table does not grow indefinitely.

Solutions
---------

First, check if you are using the `DYNAMIC row format <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/troubleshooting-row-size-too-large-errors-with-innodb/#converting-the-table-to-the-dynamic-row-format>`__.
If not, alter your tables to use this format, in order to store more data on overflow pages.

.. code-block:: sql

   ALTER TABLE tt_content ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC;

Else, here are some tips to save table row size:

* Reuse existing TYPO3 core and Content Blocks fields as much as possible.
* Try to minimize the usage of new :ref:`Text <field_type_text>`, :ref:`Link <field_type_link>`, :ref:`Email <field_type_email>`, :ref:`Radio <field_type_radio>`, :ref:`Color <field_type_color>` and :ref:`Select <field_type_select>` fields. They all use `varchar(255)`, :ref:`Link <field_type_link>` fields even use `varchar(1024)`.
* You can manually manipulate your YAML definitions using the property `alternativeSql` and change the sql :sql:`varchar` fields to :sql:`text`, as suggested `here <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/troubleshooting-row-size-too-large-errors-with-innodb/#converting-some-columns-to-blob-or-text>`__.
* If applicable, use :ref:`Collections <field_type_collection>`, as they create a new table.
* Otherwise consider creating an own extension with custom tables if your Content Blocks are getting too complex.
