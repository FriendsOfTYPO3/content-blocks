==================
Core Content Types
==================

Here is an overview of the required and optional languages / places for defining
new Content Types the Core way (without Content Blocks). See also:
:ref:`Create a custom content element type <t3coreapi:adding-your-own-content-elements>`.
Note that Content Blocks uses these technologies under the hood and you should
still learn these to understand how TYPO3 works internally.

**SQL**

When you need a custom field or a custom table, first of all you have to define
a :ref:`SQL schema <t3coreapi:ext_tables-sql>`. This requires knowledge of
MySQL syntax and which column types are suitable for the field. Content
Blocks already knows which types are the best for the job and adds them via a
PSR-14 Event. For experienced integrators, it is still possible to override
the default SQL definitions.

**TCA**

The :ref:`Table Configuration Array <t3tca:start>` is a TYPO3 specific PHP
structure to define the behavior of SQL columns inside the TYPO3 backend. It is
quite powerful and has plenty of options. In order to not limit the capabilities
of Content Blocks all options and field types are still available. You will
recognize them in the YAML definition. There are some improvements, which
required slight naming changes. Content Blocks greatly reduces the amount of
code, which needs to be defined, by automatically generating redundant
information. E.g. by adding new types to the type selector or placing custom
fields to a designated destination. Also icons are registered automatically,
if they are placed in a fixed folder.

**XML / FlexForm**

If one wants to make use of :ref:`TYPO3 FlexForms <t3coreapi:flexforms>`, it is
required to define an XML file and register it in TCA. Content Blocks
streamlines this by using the same syntax for both normal fields and FlexForm
fields. There is no need to write TCA inside of XML anymore. Everything is
handled in the single YAML definition.

**XML / XLF**

Translatable labels are implemented by using :ref:`XLF files <t3coreapi:xliff>`
in TYPO3. In Content Blocks you still have to write those. However, all fields
get a fixed key, which consists of the Content Block name and the field
identifier. You only need to remember this standardized schema and they will
automatically be used for the backend labels. There is a fallback to the field
identifier, if no entry for the field is defined, so that you never encounter
fields without a label.

**TSConfig**

:ref:`TSConfig <t3coreapi:tsconfig>` is special variant of TypoScript, which
allows to modify the backend behavior. It is required to define some TSConfig in
order to register Content Elements in the Content Element Wizard. Content Blocks
already holds all necessary information for this and adds default TSConfig. If
not otherwise defined, new Content Elements are placed in the "common" tab.

**TypoScript**

:ref:`TypoScript <t3tsref:start>` is the glue between the backend and the
frontend. For Content Elements specifically it is required to define a
rendering definition, if you intend to display them in the frontend. Content
Blocks automatically adds default TypoScript, which registers a Fluid
template for the Content Element. In addition, all relations are resolved
automatically, so you don't have to define DataProcessors for common use
cases like file references or collections.

**Fluid**

:ref:`Fluid <t3coreapi:fluid-introduction>` is the templating engine for TYPO3
and is both used in the backend and the frontend. Content Blocks registers a
`frontend.html` and a `backend-preview.html` file, which can immediately be used
for styling your Content Element. Layouts and partials can be used as usual.
